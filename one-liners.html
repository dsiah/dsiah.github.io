	<h2>Python One-Liners</h2>
	<p><a href="index.html">&#65513; Home</a></p>
	<p>The title is a bit of a misnomer. This is where I try to archive some tricks neat algorithms, functions, list comprehensions, etc. that have been compressed to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">certain degree</a></p>

	<p>I run across tons of cool python snippets. Typically, I try to keep track of these tricks. I have split them across lines to ensure the code doesn't go off the page or to increase readibility</p>
