		There are many algorithms for generating mazes. Eller's Maze generation algorithm is a popular algorithm that produces a <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/glossary.htm" target="_blank">low-bias</a> maze in efficient time and space.
	</p>

	<h3>Encoding Mazes</h3>
	<p>
		Before we discuss the algorithm, let's take a step back and discuss methods for encoding mazes. If there is one thing you take away from this discussion, it is that <b>mazes are graphs</b> and while you may interpret graphs as the cartesian plane, graphs are more generally a "bunch of dots" and "lines between the dots". 
		<span class="marginnote" style="margin-top: 10;">

			<b>Pictured</b>: the Cartesian plane, or coordinate system. The space where we project visual representations of curves, lines, and shapes in 2 dimensions (or less), as well as our irrational hatred of grade school math class.
		</span>
		These dots and lines are more formally called <b>vertices</b> and <b>edges</b>. In this paticular case these mazes are trees (graphs with no loops) and therefore:
		<blockquote> Mazes &#65515; Trees &#65515; Graphs. </blockquote>
	</p>

	<p>
		Graphs are very useful for real world problems. These algorithms are integral to logistics, biology, language, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylare5LoDdE" target="_blank">search engines</a>. So in this sense graphs are pretty cool.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A maze is a specific type of graph where each vertice is either connected to its North neighbor (1), South neighbor (2), West neighbor (4), East neighbor (8), or any combonation of N/S/W/E. However, there are some limitations to our definition of mazes. First, a maze must be a tree meaning there will be no loops in the graph. Second, a maze will have no vertex which are not accessible from any other vertex.
	</p>

	<p>
		Knowing this we can encode the maze as a matrix of edges. If we arrange the cells in an ordered grid it might make sense to create a 2D Matrix containing each cell's edges. This is a good starting point, but we can streamline this with some <i>clever tricks</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		2D Matrices can be rewritten as 1D Matrices (or Vectors (or Arrays)).
		If we had a 4x4 Matrix, this could be converted into a Vector containing 16 values.
		Almost all programming languages index their arrays at 0 so this vector would contain the indices 0 - 15.
		How do we transition between 2D coordinates and the single dimension coordinates of the cell? 
	</p>

	<p>
		Easy, given (x, y, n) where x is the column-number and y is row-number and n is the length of the side of the matrix.
	</p>

	<pre>location = (n * y) + x</pre>
	<p>Breakdown:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Calculate: <pre>offset = y * n</pre></li>
		<li>Add: <pre>location = x + offset</pre></li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
		There's another clever trick for representing edges. Remember those numbers that we assigned N/S/W/E to? If not here it is again: <b>North (1), South (2), West (4), East (8)</b>.
		Using the powers of two we can represent a bunch of edges as the sum of the numbers that represent each edge. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, 9 would mean the edges of this vertex would be East (8) and North (1). All we need to do is check to see if the sum is larger than the edges starting from East and moving to North. If the sum is larger we know the edge exists and we subtract from the "edge sum".  The reason this works is because each sum between 0 and 15 can only be represented one way in this process. This may seem familiar because it the same exact process we use encode numbers in binary or Base-2 representation.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Eller's Algorithm</h3>
	<p>
		This algorithm is extremely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" target="_blank">efficient</a>. The process is practically instantaneous in the browser environment and it moves in  a linear fashion from top to bottom. Eller's algorithm is based on the idea of mapping cells in the maze to sets and then merging these sets together when connections are (randomly) established between disjoint sets.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Initialize the first row with new sets</li>
		<li>Randomly connect verticies that belong to different sets (add the east edge)</li>
		<li>Randomly add south edges to <b>at least one</b> vertex for each set</li>
		<li>Initialize next row's verticies with new sets if they are not connected to a vertex above, otherwise use the sets from the vertex above</li>
		<li>Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the last row</li>
		<li>In our final row, connect every vertex that belongs to different sets</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
		This produces a tree that includes each node once. We call this a spanning tree. This tree is essentially equivalent to a maze.
