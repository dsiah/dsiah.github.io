	<h2>The Rules of Rack-O</h2>

	<p>
		About a year ago my friends and I discovered a weird card game called Rack-O. Each player has a hand of cards that they must <b>sort</b>. The catch is that they can only move <b>one card per turn</b>, in one of two ways:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			Take a card from the deck, swapping it with one card from their hand, and placing the old card in the discard pile.
		</li>
		<li>
			Take the top card from the discard pile, swap it with one card from their hand, and place the old card in the discard pile face up.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Order can be established in any sort of way but traditionally the players each take a card, the lowest card designates the dealer and the player to the left of the dealer starts. The game starts with one card being turned over onto the discard pile.
	</p>

	<h2>Design Decisions</h2>

	<p>
		I have begun prototyping the game engine in python, it's a relatively simple concept that translates well to Object Oriented structure. For example a <b>Deck</b> has <b>Cards</b> and a <b>Player</b> has a hand which has <b>Cards</b>. The real fun comes with implementing this game in real time. I would like to take this game engine and place it at the heart of an asynchronous web server that can host a game and broadcast changes. Right now the greatest challenge is how I will prevent players from inspecting the state of other players hands. With a web server I can distribute each hand to the client preventing them from seeing the entire state of the game, but I have decided to hold off on making this decision until I complete some research on distributed games. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Ideally I would like this game to be simultaneously mobile and browser based. Most of the inspiration comes from what I like to call "distributed games" in which people can connect to each other's devices and play between a network. My favorite example in recent memory is a game called Space Team. But the main hinderance is that a connection mustbe opened between client and server instead of a simple network from device to device.
	</p>

	<p>
		Currently I am thinking of using a framework like <a href="http://socket.io/">socket.io</a> to open socket connections to a server which would distribute the game information appropriately but there may be a more elegant solution...
